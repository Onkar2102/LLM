# Exploring Text Summarization: From Langchain to Map Reduce

The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze various advanced methodologies in text summarization. This includes the study and application of tools like Langchain, the development of custom prompt templates, the investigation of StuffDocumentChain for efficient summarization, and the utilization of map reduce techniques for handling large documents. The project aims to compare these approaches, highlight their strengths and limitations, and demonstrate their practical applications in the field of natural language processing and information retrieval. Through this comprehensive exploration, the project seeks to contribute to the evolving landscape of text summarization techniques, providing insights and tools for researchers and practitioners in the domain.
